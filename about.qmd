I am a father, husband, and data scientist, currently residing in Philadelphia,
PA. I am currently the Lead Data Scientist at [Activate
Care](https://www.activatecare.com/) (October 2022). 

Professionally, I have a dual passion for software engineering and applied
statistics with a particular love for all things related to causal inference.
At the end of the day, I am most excited by professional and educational
opportunities that give me the opportunity to grow in these areas. I completed
a master’s degree in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania (May
2022) and received my undergraduate education at American University where I
majored in Mathematics & Economics and Philosophy (May 2014).

Most of my time outside of work is spent with family, friends, and being
involved in our local church community ([Citylight Church Center
City](https://citylightcentercity.com/)). Since high school, I have cultivated
an interest in Christian apologetics, motivated by 1 Peter 3:15-16:

>"but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to
make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you;
yet do it with gentleness and respect”

I love to cook, make pour-over coffee, and play sports. I was a competitive
gymnast for 10 years, dove for a year in high school, and then played ultimate
frisbee in college and for a bit afterwards. At this point, I restrict myself
to tennis, jogging, and calisthenics to avoid what seemed to be a constant
stream of injuries.
